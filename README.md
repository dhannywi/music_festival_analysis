# Music Festival Analysis
The festival organizers want to improve the festival. They wanted to understand which performance are bringing them the most profits and where they are falling short. Using the class_music_festival database, I will perform exploratory analysis using SQL to help the organizers get a sense of the festival’s performance and answer some of the organizer’s burning questions below:

1. The organizers had announced a giveaway for the first 10 customers. They wanted to know the attendee’s names to announce the winners.
2. When was the first ticket to a performance at the venue BMI purchased?
3. When is the first show (band name, venue name and start time) that ‘Osderbiq ’ has a ticket to?
4. What is the name of the person who spent the most (and how much did they spend)?
5. What is the name of the band performing at the AMD venue that had the highest fee?
6. How many tickets were sold for the performance that started at 2011-09-18 20:30:00?
7. Which bands performed at the venue with more than 2000 capacity?
8. Which performance and venue had the highest revenue?
9. Which performance (and by which band) was the most profitable?
10. Which band was the least profitable for the festival?
11. Which venues were oversold and what were their capacities?
12. What was the total revenue from ticket sales each month?
13. What was the average purchase total each month?

### Conclusion
Looking at the analysis above, the festival organizers will need to ensure that they are not overselling tickets for the AMD venue since overcrowding may result in decrease of attendee’s enjoyment of the performance. FRom the analysis we have concluded that Preservation Hall Jazz Band and The Del McCoury Band and Vista Equity had the highest revenue, while the band WAX is the least profitable. The organizers can consider tracking attendee’s enjoyment of each performance, in a way that makes it possible to ask which bands/venues are the most popular.
